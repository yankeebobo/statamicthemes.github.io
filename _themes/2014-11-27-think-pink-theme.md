Taken from Steph's website:

Great learning experience and my first theme for Statamic. I tried to keep it very simple so that it could be applied to other sites as well. Due to the global changes you can make you can switch out the pink very easily.

This theme is based off of the baseline theme put together by Garth Redfern. It uses the UIkit framework, lightbox2 and owlcarousel. The theme requires a Statamic license which is purchase-able from their website. Special thanks to Jason Varga for the global addon. Thanks to @Mozammil_K for his feedback!


Global settings allow you to easily switch out the pink colors, upload your own logo and create callouts for the sidebars from the control panel. And of course if you know your way around Statamic you can easily swap, delete and change things as you need. Please send me a shout if you need any help or find any bugs or issues.
