  I was heavily inspired by Medium for this theme. I wanted to ensure that I had my menu bar at the bottom of the post and I also wanted to have a full screen image for each post as well as the home page.

from jamescampbell.us:
I used the basic theme, Denali, and started tweaking the templates until I was happy with something unique.
Utilizing the advanced custom variable / tag features, I was able to morph it into the current version you see today, with the full screen image header, sub-title, and word count / read time display that was inspired by Medium. 
All of these I setup in the template using a custom variable that I can set for each post.
