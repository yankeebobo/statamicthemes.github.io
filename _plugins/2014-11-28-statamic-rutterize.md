This modifier takes the content piped to it, and inserts some typographic tags in the content so that type nerds can style abbreviations, create non-breaking spaces between numbers and subsequent words and creates some basic span elements for kerning. All this stuff is lifted directly from the classic Richard Rutter website [The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web](http://webtypography.net/).

The modifier is used as a pipe that modifies the content handed to it.
